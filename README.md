# Playwright UI Testing Framework

This framework is designed for end-to-end UI testing using **Playwright** with **TypeScript**, integrated with:
- **Slack Notifications** for real-time test result updates.
- **New Relic Event Logging** for observability and monitoring.
- **CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions for parallel cross-browser execution.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

### Run All Tests
To execute all tests in headless mode:
```bash
pnpm test
```

### Run Tests in UI Mode
To run tests with the Playwright Test Runner UI:
```bash
pnpm test-ui-mode
```

### Generate Test Reports
After running tests, an HTML report will be generated in the `playwright-report/` directory. Open it in your browser to view detailed results:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## ðŸ›  Configuration

### Playwright Configuration
The Playwright configuration is located in [`src/config/playwright.config.ts`](src/config/playwright.config.ts). You can modify settings such as:
- `baseURL`
- `headless` mode
- `viewport` dimensions
- Browser projects (Chromium, Firefox, Webkit)

### TypeScript Configuration
The TypeScript configuration is defined in [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json). It includes strict type checking and outputs compiled files to the `dist/` directory.

---

## ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions in [`main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml). It includes:
- Installing dependencies
- Running Playwright tests
- Uploading test reports
- Sending Slack notifications for test results
